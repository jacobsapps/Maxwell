# Data Model Requirements Plan

## Goal
Define the data model requirements for Maxwell based on existing project plans and current repo changes. No code changes in this task.

## Steps
1. Read the existing buildout plan in `context/spec/app-buildout.md` to capture intended data model scope.
2. Review current repo diffs to understand any recent changes that affect data model decisions.
3. Draft and refine a dedicated requirements document at `context/spec/data-model.md` covering entities, relationships, constraints, and user workflows.

## Verification
- Manual verification: re-read `context/spec/data-model.md` for completeness, consistency with `context/spec/app-buildout.md`, and alignment with described user workflows.
