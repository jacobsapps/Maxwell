# Plan: Update AGENTS planning wording

## Goal
Adjust AGENTS.md wording to clarify planning requirements for code changes and tasks that do not change code.

## Steps
1) Update AGENTS.md with the agreed short wording, using “tasks that don’t involve code changes.”
2) Verify change is present and formatted as intended.

## Verification
- `rg -n "Planning and verification requirements" AGENTS.md` to confirm the updated block.
