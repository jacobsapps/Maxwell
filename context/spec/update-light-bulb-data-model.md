# Plan: Update light bulb data model documentation

## Goal
Update the data model documentation with light bulb property fields derived from the light bulb research so the app can capture all relevant bulb attributes.

## Scope
- Review the existing light bulb research document.
- Update the data model markdown to include only the light bulb-specific properties needed for the app.

## Verification
- Run: `xcodebuild -list` (as a minimal build-system verification step).

## Steps
1. Review the light bulb research and current data model documentation.
2. Update the data model markdown with the required light bulb properties.
3. Run the verification command listed above.
4. Commit changes and open a PR.
