# To Do's

We need to execute this plan.

## Floor Plan Remaining Features Plan
- Add rotated-geometry helpers to `FloorPlanRoom` and update overlap/containment in `FloorPlanBuilderViewModel`.
- Enhance canvas interactions: construction-mode state for any manipulation, target highlight for bulb placement/drag, bulb snap-on-drop, and haptic feedback on success/blocked placement.
- Add rotate + resize gestures for placed rooms; hide/disable controls during manipulations; add floor order indicators and accessibility identifiers.
- Add unit tests for rotated overlap detection, floor insertion order, and bulb placement rules.
- Verification: build and compile, then simulator run and UI presence check.
