# Plan: Commit Changes and Update PR (2026-01-21)

## Goals
- Commit the current working tree changes to the existing PR branch.
- Update the PR title/body with a concise summary and testing notes.

## Steps
1) Inspect git status and diffs to confirm scope.
2) Identify any unrelated changes and get confirmation if exclusions are needed.
3) Stage relevant files only.
4) Create a commit with an agreed message.
5) Push the branch to update the existing PR.
6) Update PR metadata (title/body) with summary + testing notes.

## Verification (requires agreement before proceeding)
- No verification steps will be run unless requested.

## Notes
- If you want tests/builds, specify which (e.g., build_sim, test_sim). The plan will be updated accordingly before proceeding.
