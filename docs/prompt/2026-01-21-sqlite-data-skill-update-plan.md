# Plan: Update sqlite-data-usage skill (2026-01-21)

## Goal
Refresh the local `sqlite-data-usage` skill with current, source-backed guidance from Point-Free’s SQLiteData repo and blog post so it’s immediately usable for future work in this codebase.

## Plan
1. Review the existing `sqlite-data-usage` skill to understand current guidance and gaps.
2. Research the provided sources (SQLiteData GitHub repo + Point-Free blog post) for up-to-date usage patterns, APIs, and caveats.
3. Update the skill with structured sections, examples, and references aligned to Maxwell’s architecture requirements.
4. Verify the updated skill file content and structure.

## Verification steps (to run before done)
- Research the SQLiteData GitHub repository and Point-Free blog post and extract the API usage, setup steps, and CloudKit sync/sharing guidance needed to implement SQLiteData end-to-end.
- Confirm the updated skill file includes those findings with clear sections, examples, and references to the sources.
